# command for getting most popular anime, as well as most popular anime by genre etc
# improving search for multi-word / multi-term searches and better matching
# switching to a better API (not super important as I'm the only one using this bot rn)
# maybe user tracking for anime they've watched, anime they're currently watching, etc,
# so eventually, users can get anime recommendations based on activity
# also maybe social features like sharing anime with friends, etc
