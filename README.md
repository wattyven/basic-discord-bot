# Discord Anime Bot


a silly little bot that returns searches for anime. search for shows and movies with the command "$search", e.g. "$search fullmetal" or "$search oshi" or whatever. 


returns the top 50 results in individual pages, with synopsis, alternative titles, ranking, and airing status. WIP. 




to-do: 

- help command + docs.

- more search options, such as searching by popularity, genre, etc.

- improving multi-word search prompts and search results in multiple languages

- maybe using a different API because i honestly just used the first one i found

- user tracking? to remember what you've watched, what you enjoy, to make recommendations. (will require diff api with graphs)

- maybe some social features to help decide what ppl might want to watch together in a server.
