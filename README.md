# A Basic Discord Bot

a silly little bot that returns searches for anime and other media, and has basic chat functionality. more to come. 

leverages the anilist graphql apiv2 for search results and recommendations.


returns results in individual pages, with synopsis, alternative titles, and airing status. WIP. 

also returns currently live hololive streams, as well as upcoming streams. 




to-do: 

- ~~help command + docs.~~ $readme now includes the gist of stuff with the exception of the $chat command

- more search options, such as searching by popularity, genre, etc.

- ~~improving multi-word search prompts and search results in multiple languages~~

- ~~maybe using a different API because i honestly just used the first one i found~~ switched to anilist graphQL apiv2

- user tracking? to remember what you've watched, what you enjoy, to make recommendations. ~~(will require diff api with graphs)~~

- maybe some social features to help decide what ppl might want to watch together in a server.
