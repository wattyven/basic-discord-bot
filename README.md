# Discord Anime Bot

a silly little bot that returns searches for anime. search for shows and movies with the command "$search", e.g. "$search fullmetal" or "$search oshi" or whatever. 

returns the top 50 results in individual pages, with synopsis, alternative titles, ranking, and airing status. WIP. 



to-do: 
help command + docs.
more search options, such as searching by popularity, genre, etc.
improving multi-word search prompts and search results in multiple languages
maybe using a different API because i honestly just used the first one i found
user tracking? to remember what you've watched, what you enjoy, to make recommendations. (will require diff api with graphs)
maybe some social features to help decide what ppl might want to watch together in a server.
